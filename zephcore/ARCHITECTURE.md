## 1. Project Overview

ZephCore is a LoRa mesh networking firmware running on Zephyr RTOS. It supports four device roles:

- **Companion**: BLE-connected device paired with a phone app. Full contact/channel/message management.
- **Repeater**: Autonomous headless relay node. CLI administration via authenticated mesh connections or serial UART.
- **Room Server**: Headless store-and-forward shared message room (BBS). Reuses the repeater's ACL/region/CLI; pushes new posts to logged-in clients (per-client sync cursor + ACK).
- **Observer** (ESP32): Listen-only node that publishes received LoRa packets to MQTT over WiFi.

Supported hardware: nRF52840, nRF54L15, ESP32-C3/C6/S3, EFR32MG24 — all with SX1262 or LR1110 LoRa radios.

### Upstream Relationship

ZephCore is a port of [Arduino MeshCore](https://github.com/rmendes76/MeshCore). The core mesh protocol (Mesh.cpp, Dispatcher.cpp, Packet.cpp, Identity.cpp, Utils.cpp) is shared code. Adapters (`adapters/`) bridge MeshCore's HAL interfaces to Zephyr APIs. Binary file formats (prefs, contacts, channels) are byte-compatible with Arduino MeshCore.

## 4. Core Mesh Engine

### 4.1 Packet Lifecycle

1. **Allocation**: `StaticPoolPacketManager::allocNew()` — fixed pool of 32 `Packet` objects (no heap)
2. **Creation**: `Mesh::createDatagram()`, `createAdvert()`, `createAck()`, etc.
3. **Queuing**: `Dispatcher::sendPacket()` → `PacketManager::queueOutbound()` with priority + scheduled time
4. **Transmission**: `Dispatcher::checkSend()` → CAD check → serialize → `radio->startSendRaw()`
5. **Release**: `PacketManager::free()` after TX complete or processing done

### 4.2 Packet Structure

```
Wire format:
  [header: 1B] [transport_codes: 0 or 4B] [path_len: 1B] [path: variable] [payload: variable]

Header byte:
  Bits 0-1: Route type (0=transport_flood, 1=flood, 2=direct, 3=transport_direct)
  Bits 2-5: Payload type (0=REQ .. 15=RAW_CUSTOM)
  Bits 6-7: Version (0=v1)

Path_len byte:
  Bits 0-5: Hash count (0-63 hops)
  Bits 6-7: Hash size mode (0=1B, 1=2B, 2=3B, 3=reserved)
```

### 4.3 Payload Types

| Type | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| REQ | 0x00 | Encrypted request to peer |
| RESPONSE | 0x01 | Encrypted response from peer |
| TXT_MSG | 0x02 | Encrypted text message |
| ACK | 0x03 | 4-byte CRC acknowledgment |
| ADVERT | 0x04 | Signed identity advertisement |
| GRP_TXT | 0x05 | Group channel text message |
| GRP_DATA | 0x06 | Group channel data |
| ANON_REQ | 0x07 | Anonymous request (includes full pubkey) |
| PATH | 0x08 | Path return (source route exchange) |
| TRACE | 0x09 | Trace route |
| MULTIPART | 0x0A | Multi-ACK container |
| CONTROL | 0x0B | Control data (zero-hop) |
| RAW_CUSTOM | 0x0F | Raw custom data |

### 4.4 Routing

**Flood routing**: Packet has no destination path. Each relay node appends its identity hash to `path[]` and retransmits. Priority decreases with hop count. `allowPacketForward()` is the gatekeeper.

**Direct routing**: Packet carries a source-routed `path[]`. Each relay node checks if the first path hash matches its own identity, removes itself, and forwards. Path is built from previous flood packets' accumulated hashes.

**Deduplication**: `SimpleMeshTables` maintains a circular buffer of 160 packet hashes (8 bytes each, SHA-256 truncated); ACKs are deduped through the same packet-hash path. `wasSeen()` is a pure query; call sites insert explicitly via `markSeen()` to prevent duplicate processing and retransmission.

### 4.5 Dispatcher Scheduling

The Dispatcher runs a tight loop:

```
loop():
  1. Check if current TX is complete → release packet, record airtime
  2. Process next inbound packet from queue (if scheduled time has passed)
  3. checkRecv(): Drain radio RX ring buffer
     - Parse raw bytes into Packet
     - Flood packets: compute RX delay based on score → defer or process immediately
     - Direct packets: process immediately
  4. checkSend(): Check outbound queue
     - CAD: if channel busy (`isReceiving()` returns true or radio not ready),
            retry every 100-200ms (jittered) up to 4s total. On 4s timeout,
            call `_radio->recoverRxState()` (cancel + restart, clears IRQ +
            latch + grace timestamp) and re-wake the loop instead of falling
            through to TX.
     - Duty cycle: if exceeded, defer 5 seconds (admin packets exempt)
     - Final `isReceiving()` check right before TX (closes timing gap)
     - Serialize and transmit
```

**RX Delay**: Flood packets are delayed based on signal quality. High-quality signals (high SNR, short packets) get shorter delays, allowing closer/better relays to retransmit first. Uses a lookup table approximation of `10^(0.85 - score*0.1) - 1` multiplied by airtime.

**Duty Cycle**: Fixed 1-hour sliding window. Default 10%. Admin packets (REQ, RESPONSE, ANON_REQ, CONTROL) are exempt.

### 4.6 Maintenance Loop

Called every ~5 seconds from the main event loop:

1. **Noise floor calibration**: EMA with alpha=1/8, jitter, threshold filtering, warmup
2. **RX mode watchdog**: Flags error if radio stuck outside RX for >8 seconds
3. **AGC reset**: Periodic warm sleep + recalibration (configurable interval, default off)

### 4.7 Adaptive Contention Window

Replaces Arduino MeshCore's static `txdelay`/`rxdelay` with three complementary mechanisms.

**EMA Delay Factor (proactive)**

`ContentionTracker` measures observed duplicates per retransmitted packet using a **24-entry ring buffer** (sized for ~50-neighbor hilltop topologies with multiple concurrent in-flight floods). Each entry tracks a packet (identified by FNV-1a hash) and records how many dupes arrive within a 10-second observation window. When the window closes, the entry is finalized and an EMA is updated with alpha = 1/8. The resulting estimate feeds the delay factor formula:

```
factor = 0.05 + 0.170 * sqrt(est)
```

Capped at 2.0. During warmup (fewer than 4 finalized entries), factor defaults to 0.5. Sparse nodes converge toward near-zero delay; dense nodes get proportionally higher delay.

The flood retransmit jitter window is `5·airtime·factor` clamped by **two ceilings**:
- Airtime-scaled: `6·airtime` — keeps SF7/narrow-BW configs from wasting time in oversized windows.
- Absolute: `2000ms` — bounds per-hop latency in dense areas even when airtime is large.

**Per-Dupe Reactive Backoff**

When a duplicate of a pending outbound packet is heard, TX is rescheduled to `now + backoff_multiplier * airtime`. Each dupe triggers a full delay (not diminishing). Cumulative reactive extension is capped at `min(2000ms, 12·airtime)` per packet; after the cap, CAD handles remaining channel activity. `backoff_multiplier` is configurable via `set backoff.multiplier X` (range 0.0–2.0).

**Initial-Flood Jitter (companion-only)**

Companions don't retransmit floods, but they observe mesh contention and need to spread their *originated* transmissions to avoid colliding with repeaters still busy in TX/RX. `Mesh::passivelyTrackFloods()` (overridden to `true` on `CompanionMesh`) registers every first-hearing of a flood with the ContentionTracker, so the EMA warms up even without forwarding. `Mesh::getInitialFloodJitter(packet)` is added to the caller-supplied delay in both `sendFlood` overloads; on companion this is `rand(0, min(1000ms, 3·airtime, 5·airtime·factor))` — half the repeater's ceilings. Repeaters keep the default 0 (no double-jitter on forwards).

**Direct Packets**

Direct (source-routed) packets bypass adaptive scaling entirely. They use minimal fixed jitter: `20 + rand(0, airtime / 10)` ms.

**CLI**

- `get txdelay` — shows current adaptive state (EMA estimate, delay factor, backoff multiplier).
- `set backoff.multiplier X` — controls per-dupe reactive delay (0.0–2.0).
- `txdelay`, `rxdelay`, `direct.txdelay` — accepted for prefs compatibility but ignored at runtime.

**ContentionTracker Resource Usage**

~260 bytes RAM (24-entry ring buffer × ~16B/entry + state). FNV-1a packet hash, 10-second observation window, EMA with alpha = 1/8.

### 4.8 Encryption

- **Peer-to-peer**: ECDH shared secret (Curve25519) → AES-128-ECB encrypt → 2-byte HMAC-SHA256 MAC
- **Group channels**: SHA-256 of channel name → AES key
- **Advertisements**: Ed25519 signature over (pubkey + timestamp + app_data)
- **ACKs**: SHA-256(shared_secret + packet_hash) truncated to 4 bytes

### 4.9 Mesh Time Sync (Clock Consensus)

ZephCore-only divergence from Arduino MeshCore (like the Adaptive Contention Window). A node senses its own clock error from the Ed25519-signed timestamps in other nodes' adverts and — **opt-in, default off** (`set meshtimesync on`) — corrects it automatically. There is no trusted reference clock on a mesh, so this is a *consensus estimation* problem: the node assumes the majority of tenured advert senders within 3 flood hops is right. User-facing doc: `MESHTIMESYNC.md` at the repo root.

**Module**: `helpers/MeshTimeSync.{h,cpp}` — role-agnostic estimator, owns no clock. Each role feeds it verified adverts (`onAdvertHeard`), calls `tick()` periodically (15-min pacing internal), and applies STEP verdicts under its own policy.

**Sample table** (per-sender, `CONFIG_ZEPHCORE_TIMESYNC_TABLE_SIZE` slots: 32 default, 16 on RAM-bound companions; 24 B/slot):
- 8-byte pubkey prefix — a security floor, not a tuning knob (shorter prefixes are grindable: an attacker could collide a tenured voter's prefix and reset its tenure with validly-signed adverts).
- Latest advert timestamp (= the vote, per-sender monotonic — replays and flood dupes are inert) + arrival **uptime**. Skew is recomputed at evaluate time from the uptime anchor, so the node's own steps never stale stored samples.
- Tenure tracking: first-heard uptime, advert count. Eligibility = heard ≥ 1 h, ≥ 2 adverts, latest sample ≤ 5 days old (bridges the 47 h flood-advert cadence).
- Self-consistency: consecutive samples must satisfy `|Δadvert_ts − Δuptime| ≤ 45 s + 150 ppm × Δuptime`; violation (sender rebooted/corrected/lying) resets that sender's tenure.
- **Hop-priority admission** (hop cap 3): a new sender may only displace a young entry farther (higher hop) than it; mature entries are protected unless silent > 24 h. Naive LRU churned hub nodes to zero eligible voters in simulation.

**Consensus**: Marzullo interval intersection over eligible votes, each `[skew − r, skew + r]` with `r = 150 s + 15 s × hop` (the 150 s base covers the real fleet's good-clock scatter, not just RF delay). No absolute outlier thresholds against the local clock — clustering does the rejection, so an epoch-reset clock still finds the true cluster. Stepping requires `CONFIG_ZEPHCORE_TIMESYNC_QUORUM` (default 6, floor 3, build-time security knob) eligible senders AND a strict majority inside the intersection; otherwise abstain.

**Correction policy** (priority: GPS > manual set > mesh consensus):
- GPS gate: nodes whose GPS delivered a validated fix within **72 h** never step (covers the repeater's 48 h GPS duty cycle with margin). Only a real fix makes the mesh yield — a GPS that is enabled but cannot fix (indoors, dead antenna) stops gating after the window, so those units stay mesh-correctable. Sensing always continues; the dry-run marks refused steps `(gps-gated)`.
- Manual set (`time`, `clock sync`, app time set) arms a **7-day suppression** of all stepping, bootstrap included, plus drift-envelope pedigree.
- Step trigger 10 min, dead band 5 min, step capped **±1 h**, one step per **6 h**, logged loudly. Production contains coherent wrong-time islands (+28 h × 63 repeaters at analysis time); the cap bounds capture drag to 4 h/day.
- **Drift-envelope gate**: with a trusted sync + continuous uptime since (pedigree, RAM-only), corrections beyond `elapsed × 300 ppm + 10 min` are physically impossible for a crystal — refused regardless of quorum.
- **Bootstrap**: local time < firmware build epoch (`FIRMWARE_BUILD_EPOCH`, CMake-injected) is provably wrong → any 3 agreeing senders, step to the cluster's **low edge** (midpoint − 150 s; undershoot so later refinement is always forward = monotonicity-safe).

**Per-role step policy** (policy lives in the role, not the estimator):
| Role | Policy | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Repeater | bidirectional | clock not load-bearing: forwarding/dedup/remote-admin run on `millis()`/hashes; a backward step only mutes own adverts at peers for a window equal to the step |
| Observer | bidirectional | clock only stamps observations — exactly what this fixes |
| Room server | forward-only | post timestamps feed client `sync_since` ordering |
| Companion | forward-only | own clock stamps outgoing DMs; peers hold per-sender replay high-water marks |

**Step application**: the shared policy (GPS gate, forward-only skip, uint32-overflow guard, set clock, one `zephcore_rtc_save` per step — never per evaluation) lives in `MeshTimeSync::runTick()`; when it returns true, the role shifts its wall-clock-anchored bookkeeping by `lastStepDelta()` — repeater: neighbor `heard_timestamp`s, ACL `last_activity`, login/anon/discover rate-limiter resets; room server: ACL + login limiter.

All policy timers (6 h rate limit, 7-day suppression, tenure, sample age) anchor on **uptime, never wall clock** — otherwise the very steps they govern would distort them.

**CLI**: `set meshtimesync {on|off}`, `get meshtimesync` → state + live dry-run (eligible count, votes for/against, skew/radius, would-be verdict) + per-sender evidence table (full table over local USB; remote admin replies are summary-truncated to fit the packet). Sensing always runs, so the dry-run works before enabling.

**Accepted limits**: a coordinated same-offset majority around a node captures it (no consensus survives that — Bitcoin timejacking lesson; mitigations: default-off, manual override, caps); sub-quorum islands abstain forever (bootstrap still heals dead clocks with 3 senders).

## 5. Radio Subsystem

### 5.1 Class Hierarchy

```
mesh::Radio (abstract interface)
  └── LoRaRadioBase (shared state machine, ring buffer, noise floor)
        ├── SX126xRadio → Zephyr native SX126x driver + sx126x_ext.h
        └── LR1110Radio → Custom lr11xx_lora.c driver + Semtech HAL
```

Compile-time selection via `CONFIG_ZEPHCORE_RADIO_LR1110` in `RadioIncludes.h`.

### 5.2 LoRaRadioBase State Machine

**TX Flow** (LBT — current default; `cad.mode == LORA_CAD_MODE_LBT` is set unconditionally in `buildModemConfig`):
1. `startSendRaw()` → `isReceiving()` final gate → `_tx_active = 1` → **skip** `hwCancelReceive()` and leave `_in_recv_mode = 1` so the driver sees state == RX → `configureTx()` → async send.
2. SX126x `send_async` entry CAS accepts both `REST_STATE → TX` and `RX → TX`, recording `was_rx`. LBT branch issues `set_standby(RC)` then SetCAD. On CAD-busy: in-driver `sx126x_restart_rx` puts the chip back in RX before `-EBUSY` returns. C++ failure path calls `startReceive()`, which the driver's `lora_recv_async` short-circuits when state is already RX.
3. On TX success: `_in_recv_mode = 0`, TX wait thread blocks on semaphore (5 s timeout).
4. On DIO1 `TX_DONE` interrupt → signal raised → restart RX → update stats.

**RX Flow**:
1. `lora_recv_async()` with callback. SX126x `recv_async` clears `IRQ_ALL` and resets the RX-busy signals on every fresh entry.
2. ISR writes to 8-slot SPSC ring buffer (drops NEW packet on overflow).
3. Main thread drains via `recvRaw()`.

**Config Caching**: Avoids redundant `lora_config()` calls. Fast-path for TX↔RX transitions when only direction differs. `recoverRxState()` clears the cache (`_config_cached = false`) so post-recovery RX goes through the full path.

### 5.2.1 RX-Busy Gate (TX-during-RX prevention)

`LoRaRadioBase::isReceiving()` is the single software source of truth for "currently receiving" and is consulted at three sites: dispatcher initial gate, dispatcher final gate, and `startSendRaw`'s last-moment gate. Logic:

```
isReceiving()
  ├─ false if !_in_recv_mode || _tx_active
  ├─ true  if hwIsReceiving()         ← per-adapter; never clears IRQ
  └─ isChannelActive() RSSI fallback  ← sub-preamble-threshold energy
```

For SX126x, `hwIsReceiving()` → `sx126x_is_receiving()` reads in this order:
1. **`data->rx_packet_active`** latch (no SPI). Set by the work handler on `HEADER_VALID`; cleared on every terminal event and RX (re)start. Covers the full payload phase.
2. **Mutex-busy conservative** — if the SPI mutex is contended and `state == RX`, return true (the work handler is likely mid-`RxDone`).
3. **`HEADER_VALID` raw bit** — covers the microseconds between DIO1 firing and the work handler running.
4. **`PREAMBLE_DETECTED` raw bit with SF-aware grace** — `PREAMBLE_DETECTED` is masked off DIO1 (fires on noise), but visible in the IRQ register. On first observation, `is_receiving` records `data->preamble_seen_at_ms`; subsequent calls return true until either `HEADER_VALID` promotes the latch (timestamp reset) or `(preamble_len + 8) × 2^SF / BW` ms elapses — at which point the bit is explicitly cleared and TX is allowed. Grace scales with SF: ~82 ms at SF8, ~786 ms at SF12.

The poll path is otherwise non-destructive — IRQ bits are cleared only by the work-handler bulk clear (on any DIO1 event), explicit `clear_irq_status(IRQ_ALL)` at every RX (re)start, and the grace-expiry one-bit clear for foreign preambles.

### 5.2.2 CAD-Timeout Recovery

`Dispatcher::checkSend()` tracks `cad_busy_start` while `isReceiving()` keeps the TX gate closed. If 4 s elapse (`getCADFailMaxDuration()`), the dispatcher calls `_radio->recoverRxState()` and returns. `LoRaRadioBase::recoverRxState()` does:

```cpp
hwCancelReceive();              // RX → IDLE → STANDBY → SLEEP (REST_STATE)
atomic_set(&_in_recv_mode, 0);  // resync C++ side
_config_cached = false;         // force full lora_config on the way back
startReceive();                 // CAS(REST → RX) clears latch + IRQ
```

This walks the chip through REST so the driver's `lora_recv_async` entry CAS (`REST_STATE → RX`) actually succeeds — a bare `startReceive()` from `state == RX` would fail with `-EBUSY` and set `_in_recv_mode = 0` while the driver still thinks it's in RX. After recovery, the dispatcher fires `_tx_queued_cb(1, ...)` to re-wake the loop promptly.

### 5.3 Noise Floor EMA

Algorithm in `triggerNoiseFloorCalibrate()`:
- 8 RSSI samples per tick, take median (insertion-sort midpoint)
- Threshold filter: reject samples ≥ floor + 14dB (after 8-tick warmup)
- Periodic bypass: every 16th tick accepts unconditionally
- EMA: `floor += round_nearest((sample - floor) / 8)`, clamped to [-120, -50] dBm

### 5.4 LR1110 Driver Errata Workarounds

The custom `lr11xx_lora.c` driver handles several LR1110 firmware bugs:
- **CMD_ERROR IRQ**: Benign error flag on several write commands — cleared silently
- **RX buffer drift**: Buffer base shifts 4 bytes per packet → `clear_rxbuffer()` after every RX
- **Header error**: Can shift buffer pointer → standby before RX restart
- **DIO1 stuck HIGH**: 5-cycle detection → full hardware reset + recovery
- **RX duty cycle**: wired via `SetRxDutyCycle` MODE_RX, sized by the shared adapter math (same as SX126x). The earlier "broken, 23-40% loss" verdict was a window-sizing bug (over-sleep + no header budget), not a chip defect — default-off, HW-verify before production use.

## 6. Application Layer

### 6.1 Class Hierarchy

```
mesh::Mesh
├── BaseChatMesh (contacts, channels, messages, connections)
│   └── CompanionMesh (BLE protocol, phone sync, offline queue, ACK tracking)
└── RepeaterMesh (ClientACL, RegionMap, CLI, rate limiting, neighbor tracking)
```

### 6.2 CompanionMesh

Handles the binary BLE protocol with ~60 command opcodes. Key features:
- **Offline queue**: 16-frame circular buffer with peek/confirm pattern (survives BLE drops)
- **ACK tracking**: 8-slot table, computes expected ACK = SHA256(secret + hash)[0:4]
- **Contact iteration**: Streaming protocol with `lastmod` filtering for incremental sync
- **Lazy write batching**: Dirty contacts/channels flush after 5-second delay
- **Protocol versioning**: V2/V3 frame format negotiation with phone app
- **Ed25519 signing**: 3-phase flow (start→data→finish) for signing up to 8KB
- **Flood scope**: Transport key filtering for region-scoped sends

### 6.3 RepeaterMesh

Autonomous operation features:
- **Authentication**: Password-based login with timestamp replay protection (120s window)
- **Permission levels**: GUEST(0), READ_ONLY(1), READ_WRITE(2), ADMIN(3)
- **Region filtering**: `RegionMap` with transport key matching per flood packet
- **Rate limiting**: 4 requests per 120s (discovery), 4 per 180s (anonymous)
- **Neighbor tracking**: 16-slot table with RSSI/SNR/name/timestamp
- **Temporary radio params**: `tempradio` command applies freq/bw/sf/cr via `LoRaRadioBase::setRadioOverride()` (does not mutate `_prefs`); auto-revert timer calls `clearRadioOverride()` to fall back to saved prefs

### 6.4 CommonCLI Commands

System: `ver`, `board`, `reboot`, `start dfu`, `start ota`, `erase`
Config: `set name/freq/radio/tx/flood.max/password/...`, corresponding getters
GPS: `gps on/off/setloc/advert`
Sensors: `sensor get/set/list`
Stats: `stats-core/stats-radio/stats-packets`, `clear stats`
Power: `powersaving on/off`

## 7. Hardware Adapters

### 7.1 BLE (`adapters/ble/`)

- Nordic UART Service (NUS) with AUTHEN permissions on CCC + RX (forces pairing)
- Passkey-based MITM pairing (SC + MITM + Bonding), runtime configurable PIN via `app_passkey` callback
- DisplayOnly IO capability — phone enters passkey displayed on device / known to user
- Advertising always uses `BT_LE_ADV_OPT_USE_IDENTITY` — exposes the stable identity address even when privacy is enabled, preserving Android connect-from-app
- `CONFIG_BT_PRIVACY` **disabled** on nRF52840 / MG24: identity address is advertised directly; both iOS and Android work without RPA. Android's Flutter BLE plugin fails `connectGatt()` to RPA-advertised devices from app context.
- `CONFIG_BT_PRIVACY` **enabled** on ESP32-S3 (`boards/common/esp32_common.conf`): the Espressif controller's privacy-OFF Secure-Connections path produces a MIC failure against iOS (HCI disconnect `0x3d` at encryption start). Privacy ON keeps the controller on its working SC path. `USE_IDENTITY` advertising preserves Android compatibility. Do **not** remove `USE_IDENTITY` while ESP32 privacy is on.
- Pairing triggered reactively: phone hits ATT error 0x05 on secured attribute → initiates SMP pairing (Apple Accessory Design Guidelines §55 compliant — no proactive Security Request)
- TX congestion control: queue (12 frames) + overflow buffer + retry + timeout watchdog
- Fast/slow advertising switching with post-disconnect flap prevention
- DLE (Data Length Extension) to 251 bytes
- Interface coexistence: BLE vs USB, one active at a time
- Debug: `boards/common/ble_debug.conf` overlay enables DBG on bt_smp/att/gatt/conn

### 7.2 DataStore (`adapters/datastore/`)

- **Internal**: LittleFS on flash (`/lfs`), 256-byte cache for reduced flash I/O
- **External**: Optional LittleFS on QSPI (`/ext`) with auto-migration
- **BLE bonds**: NVS (`storage_partition`, 0xD0000 on nRF52) via Zephyr settings backend (≥1.16.2)
- **Prefs**: 292-byte binary format, Arduino-compatible, field-by-field I/O (see §13)
- **Contacts**: 152-byte records, stored on external flash if available
- **Channels**: 68-byte records (4 pad + 32 name + 32 secret)
- **Blobs**: Fixed-size records with LRU eviction by timestamp

**First-boot migration (3-way FS self-heal)**

A marker file `/lfs/_zc_init` is written after the first clean ZephCore boot. On every subsequent boot it is present and the logic below is skipped. On first boot (marker absent), `main_companion.cpp` picks one of three paths before `bt_enable()` runs:

1. **No prefs, or Arduino MeshCore prefs** → full LFS + NVS format. Arduino's `new_prefs` omits `node_lat`/`node_lon`, shifting `freq`/`sf`/`bw` by 16 bytes; `prefsLookLikeArduino()` detects this by range-checking those fields. Covers fresh installs and Arduino → ZephCore migrations.
2. **Valid ZephCore prefs + `/lfs/settings` present** → NVS-only erase (`formatNVSOnly()`). ZephCore ≤1.16.1 stored BLE bonds in `/lfs/settings` (file backend); ≤1.16.1 used 0xD0000 as app code, so bytes there may pass NVS sector validation and hang `settings_load()`. Identity/prefs/contacts are preserved; re-pairing is required.
3. **Valid ZephCore prefs + no `/lfs/settings`** → skip format entirely. NVS was already initialised by ZephCore ≥1.16.2; bonds survive the upgrade.

`loadPrefs()` also range-checks `freq`/`sf`/`bw` after deserialisation and reverts to compile-time defaults on out-of-range values, so a misread Arduino prefs file never corrupts the radio config.

### 7.3 GPS (`adapters/gps/`)

- State machine: OFF → ACQUIRING → STANDBY (with warm standby on supported hardware)
- 3 consecutive good fixes (≥4 satellites) required before reporting
- Multi-constellation: GPS+GLONASS+Galileo+BeiDou with fallback
- T1000-E: Complex 6-GPIO power sequencing with VRTC preservation
- GPS time blocks phone time sync for 2 hours after last fix

**Duty cycle vs always-on**

`gps_wake_interval_ms` (initialised from `prefs.gps_interval`) controls the mode:

- **Duty cycling** (`gps_wake_interval_ms > 0`): after acquiring 3 good fixes the GPS powers down; the state machine wakes it again after the configured standby interval. The fix callback fires and then the GPS sleeps.
- **Always-on** (`gps_wake_interval_ms == 0`): the GPS never powers down. `consecutive_good_fixes` is reset after each promotion so the 3-fix gate cycles continuously, streaming fresh positions. Flash writes and fix callbacks are rate-limited to once per `gps_acquire_timeout_ms` to avoid hammering storage.

`gps_set_poll_interval_sec(0)` switches to always-on live; persisted via `prefs.gps_interval` (set by `set gps duty 0`).

**Timeout split**

Two separate timeouts apply to acquisition:

- `CONFIG_ZEPHCORE_GPS_FIRST_FIX_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 300s): the cold-start window used for the very first acquisition after `gps_enable()`. Longer to allow almanac download.
- `CONFIG_ZEPHCORE_GPS_FIX_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 120s): the normal per-wake timeout for all subsequent acquisitions (warm start).

**Repeater mode**

Repeaters and room servers default to `CONFIG_ZEPHCORE_REPEATER_GPS_INTERVAL_SEC` (48 h) for GPS duty — GPS wakes only for a periodic time-sync fix (5-minute acquire window). The interval is now unified with companion via `prefs.gps_interval` and is configurable at runtime via `set gps duty <sec>`; persists across reboots.

### 7.4 USB (`adapters/usb/`)

- **CompanionUSB**: V3-framed CDC (little-endian 16-bit length prefix + payload)
- **RepeaterUSB**: Minimal CDC with 1200-baud DFU touch detection
- Both share message queues with BLE adapter (transport-agnostic mesh layer)

### 7.5 Board (`adapters/board/`)

- Battery ADC with optional regulator-gated voltage divider, 8-sample average (boards with `zephyr,user` ADC node; MG24 has no battery divider, ADC disabled)
- UF2 bootloader entry via GPREGRET magic (0x57 = UF2, 0xA8 = BLE DFU)
- TX LED bracketing for LoRa transmissions
- Bootloader version detection via flash memory scan

```
Hardware buttons → Zephyr input subsystem → Longpress filter → Multi-tap filter
    → ui_input_cb() → page navigation / action dispatch → schedule_render()
        → render_work (50ms OLED / 200ms EPD debounce) → CFB framebuffer → display
```

### 8.2 Pages

**Companion** (11 pages): Messages, Recent, Radio, Bluetooth, Advert, GPS, Buzzer, Sensors, Offgrid, DFU, Shutdown

**Repeater** (3 pages): Status, Radio, Shutdown

### 8.3 Multi-Tap Input

Single button, up to 4 taps within 400ms window:
- 1 tap → Page next
- 2 taps → Flood advert
- 3 taps → Buzzer toggle
- 4 taps → GPS toggle (immediate, no delay)

### 8.4 Buzzer

Non-blocking RTTTL parser on dedicated work queue. Predefined melodies for startup, shutdown, messages, ACKs. 2-second safety watchdog auto-silences on work queue stall.

### 8.5 Doom Easter Egg

Wolf3D-style raycaster on OLED: textured walls, 2 enemy types, shooting, HUD. Bypasses CFB, writes directly to display. ~1.7KB RAM, ~5KB flash. Enabled via `CONFIG_ZEPHCORE_EASTER_EGG_DOOM`. Button UI: triple-press ENTER on Messages page. Joystick UI: Tools menu → "Doom".

## 14. Key Call Flows

### 14.1 Receiving a LoRa Packet → Application

```
DIO1 interrupt → Zephyr lora driver → async RX callback
  → LoRaRadioBase::rxCallbackStatic() → SPSC ring buffer write → _rx_cb()
    → k_event_post(MESH_EVENT_LORA_RX) → main thread wakes
      → Dispatcher::loop() → checkRecv() → drain ring buffer
        → tryParsePacket() → score + airtime calc
          → flood: dedup + adaptive contention delay → queue for retransmit
          → direct: process immediately
            → Mesh::onRecvPacket() → decrypt → dispatch by type
              → BaseChatMesh::onPeerDataRecv() → onMessageRecv()
                → CompanionMesh: writeFrame() to phone or queueOfflineMessage()
```

### 14.2 Sending a Text Message

```
Phone sends CMD_SEND_TXT_MSG via BLE NUS
  → CompanionMesh::handleProtocolFrame()
    → BaseChatMesh::sendMessage(contact, text)
      → composeMsgPacket(): ECDH secret → AES encrypt → MAC
      → if contact has path: trySendDirect()
      → else: sendFlood()
        → Mesh::sendFlood() → mark seen → queue outbound
          → Dispatcher::checkSend() → CAD check → duty cycle check → LBT → startSendRaw()
```

### 14.3 Repeater Forwarding a Packet

```
Dispatcher::checkRecv() → Mesh::onRecvPacket()
  → flood packet, not for us
    → routeRecvPacket() → allowPacketForward()
      → RepeaterMesh checks: disable_fwd? flood_max? region filter?
        → if allowed: append self hash to path, ACTION_RETRANSMIT_DELAYED
          → re-queued outbound with priority = hop count
```

### 14.4 Noise Floor Calibration Cycle

```
main event loop (every 5s) → Dispatcher::maintenanceLoop()
  → radio->triggerNoiseFloorCalibrate(threshold)
    → guards: in RX? TX active? duty cycle? mid-receive?
    → read 8 RSSI samples, take median
    → first sample: seed directly
    → warmup (<8 ticks): accept unconditionally
    → periodic bypass (every 16th): accept unconditionally
    → otherwise: reject if sample ≥ floor + 14dB
    → EMA: floor += round((sample - floor) / 8)
    → clamp [-120, -50] dBm
```
