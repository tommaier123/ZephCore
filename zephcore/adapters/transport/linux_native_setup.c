 * SPI/GPIO, and the radio's BUSY / DIO1 (CAD, TX-done, RX-done) signals
 * arrive in real time.  Without real-time mode the simulated clock races
 * ahead of the hardware and every radio timeout fires prematurely (CAD
 * -ETIMEDOUT, TX/RX stalls).  Equivalent to always passing --rt, so the
 * binary no longer needs that flag.
