 * MeshTimeSync - mesh clock consensus from Ed25519-signed advert timestamps.
 *
 * Role-agnostic estimator plus shared step policy. Each role feeds it
 * signature-verified adverts (onAdvertHeard) and calls runTick() from its
 * loop; runTick applies the shared policy (7-day suppression armed by any
 * manual or GPS clock set, forward-only roles skip backward steps, ±1 h cap,
 * 6 h rate limit) and steps the given clock. Role-specific bookkeeping (neighbor/ACL timestamp
 * shifts, rate-limiter resets) happens in the role after runTick returns
 * true. ZephCore-only divergence from Arduino MeshCore — design rationale
 * in ARCHITECTURE.md, user-facing doc in MESHTIMESYNC.md.
 *
 * All policy timers anchor on uptime, never wall clock, so the very steps
 * they govern cannot distort them. Main-thread-only, like the mesh classes
 * that own it.
